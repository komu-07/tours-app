/**********************TOURS APP******************************/
This is my third react.js project
Here I created two components -  one is the tours for mapping my fetched data(array) and the other one tour for each single item and rendered it in app.js and also added some special functionalities like read more button using useState , delete button for each tour , refresh button for refetching all tours , etc... which ultimately makes my website small yet exciting....!
